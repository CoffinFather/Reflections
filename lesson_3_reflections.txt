When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

  Some uses for remote repositories could be:
    1. Working with other people on the same project.
    2. You are working on the same project from multiple computers/locations.
    3. You could use a remote repository as another backup system.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  If you are working with other programmers, it wouldn't be helpful to have your files changed when you aren't expecting it.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

  A fork is a cone from one github repository to another. A clone is making an exact copy of a repository, either locally on one machine,
  or remotely via github or some other resource. A branch is a copy of the repository you are on, that is able to run commits separately
  from the master branch.
