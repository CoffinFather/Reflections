What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository, git creates the .git file.
You need to do it to create (initialize) your repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The git directory is where git stores the metadata and object databse for your project.

The working directory is a single checkout of one version of the project, it is the set of files you are currently working with. These files are pulled out of
the compressed database in the Git directory and placed on disk for you to use or modify.

The staging are is a file, generally contained in your Git directory, that stores information about what will go into your next commit.
