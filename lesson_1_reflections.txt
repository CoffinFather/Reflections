How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

  It was only slightly helpful, I just read the code :(

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

  It would be easier to go back to something I may have done earlier, but forgot how to do, or forogt that I changed.  

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: You can choose when it makes sense to have a new version
Cons: You have to remember to save/commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

   Git is made for programmers specifically, google docs is really more for editing single documents, like schoolpapers or whatever.


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Git log shows the version history and you can use git diff two compare the
 changes in two files.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    It would make me much more confident in making big changes, knowing that I can revert to an older, working version.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I'd like to incorporate it into my Android development.
